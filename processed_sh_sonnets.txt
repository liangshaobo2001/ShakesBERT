<eos> ﻿from fairest creatures we desire increase ,  <eos> that thereby beauty 's rose might never die ,  <eos> but as the riper should by time decease ,  <eos> his tender heir might bear his memory :  <eos> but thou ,  contracted to thine own bright eyes ,  <eos> feed 'st thy light 's flame with self-substantial fuel ,  <eos> making a famine where abundance lies ,  <eos> thyself thy foe ,  to thy sweet self too cruel :  <eos> thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament ,  <eos> and only herald to the gaudy spring ,  <eos> within thine own bud buriest thy content ,  <eos> and tender churl mak 'st waste in niggarding :  <eos> pity the world ,  or else this glutton be ,  <eos> to eat the world 's due ,  by the grave and thee .  <eos><eos> and dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field ,  <eos> thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now ,  <eos> will be a tatter 'd weed of small worth held :  <eos> then being asked ,  where all thy beauty lies ,  <eos> where all the treasure of thy lusty days ;  <eos> to say ,  within thine own deep sunken eyes ,  <eos> were an all-eating shame ,  and thriftless praise .  <eos> how much more praise deserv 'd thy beauty 's use ,  <eos> if thou couldst answer  ' this fair child of mine <eos> shall sum my count ,  and make my old excuse ,  ' <eos> proving his beauty by succession thine !  <eos> this were to be new made when thou art old ,  <eos> and see thy blood warm when thou feel 'st it cold .  <eos><eos> now is the time that face should form another ;  <eos> whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest ,  <eos> thou dost beguile the world ,  unbless some mother .  <eos> for where is she so fair whose unear 'd womb <eos> disdains the tillage of thy husbandry ?  <eos> or who is he so fond will be the tomb ,  <eos> of his self-love to stop posterity ?  <eos> thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee <eos> calls back the lovely april of her prime ;  <eos> so thou through windows of thine age shalt see ,  <eos> despite of wrinkles this thy golden time .  <eos> but if thou live ,  remember 'd not to be ,  <eos> die single and thine image dies with thee .  <eos><eos> upon thyself thy beauty 's legacy ?  <eos> nature 's bequest gives nothing ,  but doth lend ,  <eos> and being frank she lends to those are free :  <eos> then ,  beauteous niggard ,  why dost thou abuse <eos> the bounteous largess given thee to give ?  <eos> profitless usurer ,  why dost thou use <eos> so great a sum of sums ,  yet canst not live ?  <eos> for having traffic with thyself alone ,  <eos> thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive :  <eos> then how when nature calls thee to be gone ,  <eos> what acceptable audit canst thou leave ?  <eos> thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee ,  <eos> which ,  used ,  lives th ' executor to be .  <eos><eos> the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell ,  <eos> will play the tyrants to the very same <eos> and that unfair which fairly doth excel ;  <eos> for never-resting time leads summer on <eos> to hideous winter ,  and confounds him there ;  <eos> sap checked with frost ,  and lusty leaves quite gone ,  <eos> beauty o 'er-snowed and bareness every where :  <eos> then were not summer 's distillation left ,  <eos> a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass ,  <eos> beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft ,  <eos> nor it ,  nor no remembrance what it was :  <eos> but flowers distill 'd ,  though they with winter meet ,  <eos> leese but their show ;  their substance still lives sweet .  <eos><eos> in thee thy summer ,  ere thou be distill 'd :  <eos> make sweet some vial ;  treasure thou some place <eos> with beauty 's treasure ere it be self-kill 'd .  <eos> that use is not forbidden usury ,  <eos> which happies those that pay the willing loan ;  <eos> that 's for thyself to breed another thee ,  <eos> or ten times happier ,  be it ten for one ;  <eos> ten times thyself were happier than thou art ,  <eos> if ten of thine ten times refigur 'd thee :  <eos> then what could death do if thou shouldst depart ,  <eos> leaving thee living in posterity ?  <eos> be not self-will 'd ,  for thou art much too fair <eos> to be death 's conquest and make worms thine heir .  <eos><eos> lifts up his burning head ,  each under eye <eos> doth homage to his new-appearing sight ,  <eos> serving with looks his sacred majesty ;  <eos> and having climb 'd the steep-up heavenly hill ,  <eos> resembling strong youth in his middle age ,  <eos> yet mortal looks adore his beauty still ,  <eos> attending on his golden pilgrimage :  <eos> but when from highmost pitch ,  with weary car ,  <eos> like feeble age ,  he reeleth from the day ,  <eos> the eyes ,   'fore duteous ,  now converted are <eos> from his low tract ,  and look another way :  <eos> so thou ,  thyself outgoing in thy noon :  <eos> unlook 'd ,  on diest unless thou get a son .  <eos><eos> sweets with sweets war not ,  joy delights in joy :  <eos> why lov 'st thou that which thou receiv 'st not gladly ,  <eos> or else receiv 'st with pleasure thine annoy ?  <eos> if the true concord of well-tuned sounds ,  <eos> by unions married ,  do offend thine ear ,  <eos> they do but sweetly chide thee ,  who confounds <eos> in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear .  <eos> mark how one string ,  sweet husband to another ,  <eos> strikes each in each by mutual ordering ;  <eos> resembling sire and child and happy mother ,  <eos> who ,  all in one ,  one pleasing note do sing :  <eos> whose speechless song being many ,  seeming one ,  <eos> sings this to thee :   ' thou single wilt prove none .  ' <eos><eos> that thou consum 'st thyself in single life ?  <eos> ah !  if thou issueless shalt hap to die ,  <eos> the world will wail thee like a makeless wife ;  <eos> the world will be thy widow and still weep <eos> that thou no form of thee hast left behind ,  <eos> when every private widow well may keep <eos> by children 's eyes ,  her husband 's shape in mind :  <eos> look !  what an unthrift in the world doth spend <eos> shifts but his place ,  for still the world enjoys it ;  <eos> but beauty 's waste hath in the world an end ,  <eos> and kept unused the user so destroys it .  <eos> no love toward others in that bosom sits <eos> that on himself such murd 'rous shame commits .  <eos><eos> who for thyself art so unprovident .  <eos> grant ,  if thou wilt ,  thou art belov 'd of many ,  <eos> but that thou none lov 'st is most evident :  <eos> for thou art so possess 'd with murderous hate ,  <eos> that  'gainst thyself thou stick 'st not to conspire ,  <eos> seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate <eos> which to repair should be thy chief desire .  <eos> o !  change thy thought ,  that i may change my mind :  <eos> shall hate be fairer lodg 'd than gentle love ?  <eos> be ,  as thy presence is ,  gracious and kind ,  <eos> or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove :  <eos> make thee another self for love of me ,  <eos> that beauty still may live in thine or thee .  <eos><eos> in one of thine ,  from that which thou departest ;  <eos> and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow 'st ,  <eos> thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest ,  <eos> herein lives wisdom ,  beauty ,  and increase ;  <eos> without this folly ,  age ,  and cold decay :  <eos> if all were minded so ,  the times should cease <eos> and threescore year would make the world away .  <eos> let those whom nature hath not made for store ,  <eos> harsh ,  featureless ,  and rude ,  barrenly perish :  <eos> look ,  whom she best endow 'd ,  she gave thee more ;  <eos> which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish :  <eos> she carv 'd thee for her seal ,  and meant thereby ,  <eos> thou shouldst print more ,  not let that copy die .  <eos><eos> and see the brave day sunk in hideous night ;  <eos> when i behold the violet past prime ,  <eos> and sable curls ,  all silvered o 'er with white ;  <eos> when lofty trees i see barren of leaves ,  <eos> which erst from heat did canopy the herd ,  <eos> and summer 's green all girded up in sheaves ,  <eos> borne on the bier with white and bristly beard ,  <eos> then of thy beauty do i question make ,  <eos> that thou among the wastes of time must go ,  <eos> since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake <eos> and die as fast as they see others grow ;  <eos> and nothing  'gainst time 's scythe can make defence <eos> save breed ,  to brave him when he takes thee hence .  <eos><eos> no longer yours ,  than you yourself here live :  <eos> against this coming end you should prepare ,  <eos> and your sweet semblance to some other give :  <eos> so should that beauty which you hold in lease <eos> find no determination ;  then you were <eos> yourself again ,  after yourself 's decease ,  <eos> when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear .  <eos> who lets so fair a house fall to decay ,  <eos> which husbandry in honour might uphold ,  <eos> against the stormy gusts of winter 's day <eos> and barren rage of death 's eternal cold ?  <eos> o !  none but unthrifts .  dear my love ,  you know ,  <eos> you had a father :  let your son say so .  <eos><eos> and yet methinks i have astronomy ,  <eos> but not to tell of good or evil luck ,  <eos> of plagues ,  of dearths ,  or seasons ' quality ;  <eos> nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell ,  <eos> pointing to each his thunder ,  rain and wind ,  <eos> or say with princes if it shall go well <eos> by oft predict that i in heaven find :  <eos> but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive ,  <eos> and constant stars in them i read such art <eos> as  ' truth and beauty shall together thrive ,  <eos> if from thyself ,  to store thou wouldst convert ' ;  <eos> or else of thee this i prognosticate :  <eos>  ' thy end is truth 's and beauty 's doom and date .  ' <eos><eos> holds in perfection but a little moment ,  <eos> that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows <eos> whereon the stars in secret influence comment ;  <eos> when i perceive that men as plants increase ,  <eos> cheered and checked even by the self-same sky ,  <eos> vaunt in their youthful sap ,  at height decrease ,  <eos> and wear their brave state out of memory ;  <eos> then the conceit of this inconstant stay <eos> sets you most rich in youth before my sight ,  <eos> where wasteful time debateth with decay <eos> to change your day of youth to sullied night ,  <eos> and all in war with time for love of you ,  <eos> as he takes from you ,  i engraft you new .  <eos><eos> make war upon this bloody tyrant ,  time ?  <eos> and fortify yourself in your decay <eos> with means more blessed than my barren rhyme ?  <eos> now stand you on the top of happy hours ,  <eos> and many maiden gardens ,  yet unset ,  <eos> with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers ,  <eos> much liker than your painted counterfeit :  <eos> so should the lines of life that life repair ,  <eos> which this ,  time 's pencil ,  or my pupil pen ,  <eos> neither in inward worth nor outward fair ,  <eos> can make you live yourself in eyes of men .  <eos> to give away yourself ,  keeps yourself still ,  <eos> and you must live ,  drawn by your own sweet skill .  <eos><eos> if it were fill 'd with your most high deserts ?  <eos> though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb <eos> which hides your life ,  and shows not half your parts .  <eos> if i could write the beauty of your eyes ,  <eos> and in fresh numbers number all your graces ,  <eos> the age to come would say  ' this poet lies ;  <eos> such heavenly touches ne 'er touch 'd earthly faces .  ' <eos> so should my papers ,  yellow 'd with their age ,  <eos> be scorn 'd ,  like old men of less truth than tongue ,  <eos> and your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage <eos> and stretched metre of an antique song :  <eos> but were some child of yours alive that time ,  <eos> you should live twice , —in it ,  and in my rhyme .  <eos><eos> thou art more lovely and more temperate :  <eos> rough winds do shake the darling buds of may ,  <eos> and summer 's lease hath all too short a date :  <eos> sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines ,  <eos> and often is his gold complexion dimm 'd ,  <eos> and every fair from fair sometime declines ,  <eos> by chance ,  or nature 's changing course untrimm 'd :  <eos> but thy eternal summer shall not fade ,  <eos> nor lose possession of that fair thou ow 'st ,  <eos> nor shall death brag thou wander 'st in his shade ,  <eos> when in eternal lines to time thou grow 'st ,  <eos> so long as men can breathe ,  or eyes can see ,  <eos> so long lives this ,  and this gives life to thee .  <eos><eos> and make the earth devour her own sweet brood ;  <eos> pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws ,  <eos> and burn the long-liv 'd phoenix ,  in her blood ;  <eos> make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets ,  <eos> and do whate 'er thou wilt ,  swift-footed time ,  <eos> to the wide world and all her fading sweets ;  <eos> but i forbid thee one most heinous crime :  <eos> o !  carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow ,  <eos> nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen ;  <eos> him in thy course untainted do allow <eos> for beauty 's pattern to succeeding men .  <eos> yet do thy worst ,  old time ;  despite thy wrong ,  <eos> my love shall in my verse ever live young .  <eos><eos> hast thou ,  the master mistress of my passion ;  <eos> a woman 's gentle heart ,  but not acquainted <eos> with shifting change ,  as is false women 's fashion :  <eos> an eye more bright than theirs ,  less false in rolling ,  <eos> gilding the object whereupon it gazeth ;  <eos> a man in hue all  ' hues ' in his controlling ,  <eos> which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth .  <eos> and for a woman wert thou first created ;  <eos> till nature ,  as she wrought thee ,  fell a-doting ,  <eos> and by addition me of thee defeated ,  <eos> by adding one thing to my purpose nothing .  <eos> but since she prick 'd thee out for women 's pleasure ,  <eos> mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure .  <eos><eos> stirr 'd by a painted beauty to his verse ,  <eos> who heaven itself for ornament doth use <eos> and every fair with his fair doth rehearse ,  <eos> making a couplement of proud compare .  <eos> with sun and moon ,  with earth and sea 's rich gems ,  <eos> with april 's first-born flowers ,  and all things rare ,  <eos> that heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems .  <eos> o !  let me ,  true in love ,  but truly write ,  <eos> and then believe me ,  my love is as fair <eos> as any mother 's child ,  though not so bright <eos> as those gold candles fix 'd in heaven 's air :  <eos> let them say more that like of hearsay well ;  <eos> i will not praise that purpose not to sell .  <eos><eos> so long as youth and thou are of one date ;  <eos> but when in thee time 's furrows i behold ,  <eos> then look i death my days should expiate .  <eos> for all that beauty that doth cover thee ,  <eos> is but the seemly raiment of my heart ,  <eos> which in thy breast doth live ,  as thine in me :  <eos> how can i then be elder than thou art ?  <eos> o !  therefore love ,  be of thyself so wary <eos> as i ,  not for myself ,  but for thee will ;  <eos> bearing thy heart ,  which i will keep so chary <eos> as tender nurse her babe from faring ill .  <eos> presume not on thy heart when mine is slain ,  <eos> thou gav 'st me thine not to give back again .  <eos><eos> who with his fear is put beside his part ,  <eos> or some fierce thing replete with too much rage ,  <eos> whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart ;  <eos> so i ,  for fear of trust ,  forget to say <eos> the perfect ceremony of love 's rite ,  <eos> and in mine own love 's strength seem to decay ,  <eos> o 'ercharg 'd with burthen of mine own love 's might .  <eos> o !  let my looks be then the eloquence <eos> and dumb presagers of my speaking breast ,  <eos> who plead for love ,  and look for recompense ,  <eos> more than that tongue that more hath more express 'd .  <eos> o !  learn to read what silent love hath writ :  <eos> to hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit .  <eos><eos> thy beauty 's form in table of my heart ;  <eos> my body is the frame wherein  'tis held ,  <eos> and perspective it is best painter 's art .  <eos> for through the painter must you see his skill ,  <eos> to find where your true image pictur 'd lies ,  <eos> which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still ,  <eos> that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes .  <eos> now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done :  <eos> mine eyes have drawn thy shape ,  and thine for me <eos> are windows to my breast ,  where-through the sun <eos> delights to peep ,  to gaze therein on thee ;  <eos> yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art ,  <eos> they draw but what they see ,  know not the heart .  <eos><eos> of public honour and proud titles boast ,  <eos> whilst i ,  whom fortune of such triumph bars <eos> unlook 'd for joy in that i honour most .  <eos> great princes ' favourites their fair leaves spread <eos> but as the marigold at the sun 's eye ,  <eos> and in themselves their pride lies buried ,  <eos> for at a frown they in their glory die .  <eos> the painful warrior famoused for fight ,  <eos> after a thousand victories once foil 'd ,  <eos> is from the book of honour razed quite ,  <eos> and all the rest forgot for which he toil 'd :  <eos> then happy i ,  that love and am belov 'd ,  <eos> where i may not remove nor be remov 'd .  <eos><eos> thy merit hath my duty strongly knit ,  <eos> to thee i send this written embassage ,  <eos> to witness duty ,  not to show my wit :  <eos> duty so great ,  which wit so poor as mine <eos> may make seem bare ,  in wanting words to show it ,  <eos> but that i hope some good conceit of thine <eos> in thy soul 's thought ,  all naked ,  will bestow it :  <eos> till whatsoever star that guides my moving ,  <eos> points on me graciously with fair aspect ,  <eos> and puts apparel on my tatter 'd loving ,  <eos> to show me worthy of thy sweet respect :  <eos> then may i dare to boast how i do love thee ;  <eos> till then ,  not show my head where thou mayst prove me .  <eos><eos> the dear respose for limbs with travel tir 'd ;  <eos> but then begins a journey in my head <eos> to work my mind ,  when body 's work 's expired :  <eos> for then my thoughts ,  from far where i abide ,  <eos> intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee ,  <eos> and keep my drooping eyelids open wide ,  <eos> looking on darkness which the blind do see :  <eos> save that my soul 's imaginary sight <eos> presents thy shadow to my sightless view ,  <eos> which ,  like a jewel hung in ghastly night ,  <eos> makes black night beauteous ,  and her old face new .  <eos> lo !  thus ,  by day my limbs ,  by night my mind ,  <eos> for thee ,  and for myself ,  no quiet find .  <eos><eos> that am debarre 'd the benefit of rest ?  <eos> when day 's oppression is not eas 'd by night ,  <eos> but day by night and night by day oppress 'd ,  <eos> and each ,  though enemies to either 's reign ,  <eos> do in consent shake hands to torture me ,  <eos> the one by toil ,  the other to complain <eos> how far i toil ,  still farther off from thee .  <eos> i tell the day ,  to please him thou art bright ,  <eos> and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven :  <eos> so flatter i the swart-complexion 'd night ,  <eos> when sparkling stars twire not thou gild 'st the even .  <eos> but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer ,  <eos> and night doth nightly make grief 's length seem stronger .  <eos><eos> i all alone beweep my outcast state ,  <eos> and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries ,  <eos> and look upon myself ,  and curse my fate ,  <eos> wishing me like to one more rich in hope ,  <eos> featur 'd like him ,  like him with friends possess 'd ,  <eos> desiring this man 's art ,  and that man 's scope ,  <eos> with what i most enjoy contented least ;  <eos> yet in these thoughts my self almost despising ,  <eos> haply i think on thee ,  and then my state ,  <eos> like to the lark at break of day arising <eos> from sullen earth ,  sings hymns at heaven 's gate ;  <eos> for thy sweet love remember 'd such wealth brings <eos> that then i scorn to change my state with kings .  <eos><eos> i summon up remembrance of things past ,  <eos> i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought ,  <eos> and with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste :  <eos> then can i drown an eye ,  unused to flow ,  <eos> for precious friends hid in death 's dateless night ,  <eos> and weep afresh love 's long since cancell 'd woe ,  <eos> and moan the expense of many a vanish 'd sight :  <eos> then can i grieve at grievances foregone ,  <eos> and heavily from woe to woe tell o 'er <eos> the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan ,  <eos> which i new pay as if not paid before .  <eos> but if the while i think on thee ,  dear friend ,  <eos> all losses are restor 'd and sorrows end .  <eos><eos> which i by lacking have supposed dead ;  <eos> and there reigns love ,  and all love 's loving parts ,  <eos> and all those friends which i thought buried .  <eos> how many a holy and obsequious tear <eos> hath dear religious love stol 'n from mine eye ,  <eos> as interest of the dead ,  which now appear <eos> but things remov 'd that hidden in thee lie !  <eos> thou art the grave where buried love doth live ,  <eos> hung with the trophies of my lovers gone ,  <eos> who all their parts of me to thee did give ,  <eos> that due of many now is thine alone :  <eos> their images i lov 'd ,  i view in thee ,  <eos> and thou ,  all they ,  hast all the all of me .  <eos><eos> when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover <eos> and shalt by fortune once more re-survey <eos> these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover ,  <eos> compare them with the bett 'ring of the time ,  <eos> and though they be outstripp 'd by every pen ,  <eos> reserve them for my love ,  not for their rhyme ,  <eos> exceeded by the height of happier men .  <eos> o !  then vouchsafe me but this loving thought :  <eos>  ' had my friend 's muse grown with this growing age ,  <eos> a dearer birth than this his love had brought ,  <eos> to march in ranks of better equipage :  <eos> but since he died and poets better prove ,  <eos> theirs for their style i 'll read ,  his for his love ' .  <eos><eos> flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye ,  <eos> kissing with golden face the meadows green ,  <eos> gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy ;  <eos> anon permit the basest clouds to ride <eos> with ugly rack on his celestial face ,  <eos> and from the forlorn world his visage hide ,  <eos> stealing unseen to west with this disgrace :  <eos> even so my sun one early morn did shine ,  <eos> with all triumphant splendour on my brow ;  <eos> but out !  alack !  he was but one hour mine ,  <eos> the region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now .  <eos> yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth ;  <eos> suns of the world may stain when heaven 's sun staineth .  <eos><eos> and make me travel forth without my cloak ,  <eos> to let base clouds o 'ertake me in my way ,  <eos> hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke ?  <eos>  'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break ,  <eos> to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face ,  <eos> for no man well of such a salve can speak ,  <eos> that heals the wound ,  and cures not the disgrace :  <eos> nor can thy shame give physic to my grief ;  <eos> though thou repent ,  yet i have still the loss :  <eos> the offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief <eos> to him that bears the strong offence 's cross .  <eos> ah !  but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds ,  <eos> and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds .  <eos><eos> roses have thorns ,  and silver fountains mud :  <eos> clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun ,  <eos> and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud .  <eos> all men make faults ,  and even i in this ,  <eos> authorizing thy trespass with compare ,  <eos> myself corrupting ,  salving thy amiss ,  <eos> excusing thy sins more than thy sins are ;  <eos> for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense ;  <eos> thy adverse party is thy advocate ,  <eos> and  'gainst myself a lawful plea commence :  <eos> such civil war is in my love and hate ,  <eos> that i an accessary needs must be ,  <eos> to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me .  <eos><eos> although our undivided loves are one :  <eos> so shall those blots that do with me remain ,  <eos> without thy help ,  by me be borne alone .  <eos> in our two loves there is but one respect ,  <eos> though in our lives a separable spite ,  <eos> which though it alter not love 's sole effect ,  <eos> yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight .  <eos> i may not evermore acknowledge thee ,  <eos> lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame ,  <eos> nor thou with public kindness honour me ,  <eos> unless thou take that honour from thy name :  <eos> but do not so ,  i love thee in such sort ,  <eos> as thou being mine ,  mine is thy good report .  <eos><eos> to see his active child do deeds of youth ,  <eos> so i ,  made lame by fortune 's dearest spite ,  <eos> take all my comfort of thy worth and truth ;  <eos> for whether beauty ,  birth ,  or wealth ,  or wit ,  <eos> or any of these all ,  or all ,  or more ,  <eos> entitled in thy parts ,  do crowned sit ,  <eos> i make my love engrafted ,  to this store :  <eos> so then i am not lame ,  poor ,  nor despis 'd ,  <eos> whilst that this shadow doth such substance give <eos> that i in thy abundance am suffic 'd ,  <eos> and by a part of all thy glory live .  <eos> look what is best ,  that best i wish in thee :  <eos> this wish i have ;  then ten times happy me !  <eos><eos> while thou dost breathe ,  that pour 'st into my verse <eos> thine own sweet argument ,  too excellent <eos> for every vulgar paper to rehearse ?  <eos> o !  give thyself the thanks ,  if aught in me <eos> worthy perusal stand against thy sight ;  <eos> for who 's so dumb that cannot write to thee ,  <eos> when thou thyself dost give invention light ?  <eos> be thou the tenth muse ,  ten times more in worth <eos> than those old nine which rhymers invocate ;  <eos> and he that calls on thee ,  let him bring forth <eos> eternal numbers to outlive long date .  <eos> if my slight muse do please these curious days ,  <eos> the pain be mine ,  but thine shall be the praise .  <eos><eos> when thou art all the better part of me ?  <eos> what can mine own praise to mine own self bring ?  <eos> and what is 't but mine own when i praise thee ?  <eos> even for this ,  let us divided live ,  <eos> and our dear love lose name of single one ,  <eos> that by this separation i may give <eos> that due to thee which thou deserv 'st alone .  <eos> o absence !  what a torment wouldst thou prove ,  <eos> were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave ,  <eos> to entertain the time with thoughts of love ,  <eos> which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive ,  <eos> and that thou teachest how to make one twain ,  <eos> by praising him here who doth hence remain .  <eos><eos> what hast thou then more than thou hadst before ?  <eos> no love ,  my love ,  that thou mayst true love call ;  <eos> all mine was thine ,  before thou hadst this more .  <eos> then ,  if for my love ,  thou my love receivest ,  <eos> i cannot blame thee ,  for my love thou usest ;  <eos> but yet be blam 'd ,  if thou thyself deceivest <eos> by wilful taste of what thyself refusest .  <eos> i do forgive thy robbery ,  gentle thief ,  <eos> although thou steal thee all my poverty :  <eos> and yet ,  love knows it is a greater grief <eos> to bear love 's wrong ,  than hate 's known injury .  <eos> lascivious grace ,  in whom all ill well shows ,  <eos> kill me with spites yet we must not be foes .  <eos><eos> when i am sometime absent from thy heart ,  <eos> thy beauty ,  and thy years full well befits ,  <eos> for still temptation follows where thou art .  <eos> gentle thou art ,  and therefore to be won ,  <eos> beauteous thou art ,  therefore to be assail 'd ;  <eos> and when a woman woos ,  what woman 's son <eos> will sourly leave her till he have prevail 'd ?  <eos> ay me !  but yet thou mightst my seat forbear ,  <eos> and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth ,  <eos> who lead thee in their riot even there <eos> where thou art forced to break a twofold truth :  <eos> hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee ,  <eos> thine by thy beauty being false to me .  <eos><eos> and yet it may be said i loved her dearly ;  <eos> that she hath thee is of my wailing chief ,  <eos> a loss in love that touches me more nearly .  <eos> loving offenders thus i will excuse ye :  <eos> thou dost love her ,  because thou know 'st i love her ;  <eos> and for my sake even so doth she abuse me ,  <eos> suffering my friend for my sake to approve her .  <eos> if i lose thee ,  my loss is my love 's gain ,  <eos> and losing her ,  my friend hath found that loss ;  <eos> both find each other ,  and i lose both twain ,  <eos> and both for my sake lay on me this cross :  <eos> but here 's the joy ;  my friend and i are one ;  <eos> sweet flattery !  then she loves but me alone .  <eos><eos> for all the day they view things unrespected ;  <eos> but when i sleep ,  in dreams they look on thee ,  <eos> and darkly bright ,  are bright in dark directed .  <eos> then thou ,  whose shadow shadows doth make bright ,  <eos> how would thy shadow 's form form happy show <eos> to the clear day with thy much clearer light ,  <eos> when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so !  <eos> how would ,  i say ,  mine eyes be blessed made <eos> by looking on thee in the living day ,  <eos> when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade <eos> through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay !  <eos> all days are nights to see till i see thee ,  <eos> and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me .  <eos><eos> injurious distance should not stop my way ;  <eos> for then despite of space i would be brought ,  <eos> from limits far remote ,  where thou dost stay .  <eos> no matter then although my foot did stand <eos> upon the farthest earth remov 'd from thee ;  <eos> for nimble thought can jump both sea and land ,  <eos> as soon as think the place where he would be .  <eos> but ,  ah !  thought kills me that i am not thought ,  <eos> to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone ,  <eos> but that so much of earth and water wrought ,  <eos> i must attend time 's leisure with my moan ;  <eos> receiving nought by elements so slow <eos> but heavy tears ,  badges of either 's woe .  <eos><eos> are both with thee ,  wherever i abide ;  <eos> the first my thought ,  the other my desire ,  <eos> these present-absent with swift motion slide .  <eos> for when these quicker elements are gone <eos> in tender embassy of love to thee ,  <eos> my life ,  being made of four ,  with two alone <eos> sinks down to death ,  oppress 'd with melancholy ;  <eos> until life 's composition be recur 'd <eos> by those swift messengers return 'd from thee ,  <eos> who even but now come back again ,  assur 'd ,  <eos> of thy fair health ,  recounting it to me :  <eos> this told ,  i joy ;  but then no longer glad ,  <eos> i send them back again ,  and straight grow sad .  <eos><eos> how to divide the conquest of thy sight ;  <eos> mine eye my heart thy picture 's sight would bar ,  <eos> my heart mine eye the freedom of that right .  <eos> my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie ,  <eos> a closet never pierced with crystal eyes ;  <eos> but the defendant doth that plea deny ,  <eos> and says in him thy fair appearance lies .  <eos> to side this title is impannelled <eos> a quest of thoughts ,  all tenants to the heart ;  <eos> and by their verdict is determined <eos> the clear eye 's moiety ,  and the dear heart 's part :  <eos> as thus ;  mine eye 's due is thy outward part ,  <eos> and my heart 's right ,  thy inward love of heart .  <eos><eos> and each doth good turns now unto the other :  <eos> when that mine eye is famish 'd for a look ,  <eos> or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother ,  <eos> with my love 's picture then my eye doth feast ,  <eos> and to the painted banquet bids my heart ;  <eos> another time mine eye is my heart 's guest ,  <eos> and in his thoughts of love doth share a part :  <eos> so ,  either by thy picture or my love ,  <eos> thyself away ,  art present still with me ;  <eos> for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move ,  <eos> and i am still with them ,  and they with thee ;  <eos> or ,  if they sleep ,  thy picture in my sight <eos> awakes my heart ,  to heart 's and eye 's delight .  <eos><eos> each trifle under truest bars to thrust ,  <eos> that to my use it might unused stay <eos> from hands of falsehood ,  in sure wards of trust !  <eos> but thou ,  to whom my jewels trifles are ,  <eos> most worthy comfort ,  now my greatest grief ,  <eos> thou best of dearest ,  and mine only care ,  <eos> art left the prey of every vulgar thief .  <eos> thee have i not lock 'd up in any chest ,  <eos> save where thou art not ,  though i feel thou art ,  <eos> within the gentle closure of my breast ,  <eos> from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part ;  <eos> and even thence thou wilt be stol 'n i fear ,  <eos> for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear .  <eos><eos> when i shall see thee frown on my defects ,  <eos> when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum ,  <eos> call 'd to that audit by advis 'd respects ;  <eos> against that time when thou shalt strangely pass ,  <eos> and scarcely greet me with that sun ,  thine eye ,  <eos> when love ,  converted from the thing it was ,  <eos> shall reasons find of settled gravity ;  <eos> against that time do i ensconce me here ,  <eos> within the knowledge of mine own desert ,  <eos> and this my hand ,  against my self uprear ,  <eos> to guard the lawful reasons on thy part :  <eos> to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws ,  <eos> since why to love i can allege no cause .  <eos><eos> when what i seek ,  my weary travel 's end ,  <eos> doth teach that ease and that repose to say ,  <eos>  ' thus far the miles are measured from thy friend !  ' <eos> the beast that bears me ,  tired with my woe ,  <eos> plods dully on ,  to bear that weight in me ,  <eos> as if by some instinct the wretch did know <eos> his rider lov 'd not speed ,  being made from thee :  <eos> the bloody spur cannot provoke him on ,  <eos> that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide ,  <eos> which heavily he answers with a groan ,  <eos> more sharp to me than spurring to his side ;  <eos> for that same groan doth put this in my mind ,  <eos> my grief lies onward ,  and my joy behind .  <eos><eos> of my dull bearer when from thee i speed :  <eos> from where thou art why should i haste me thence ?  <eos> till i return ,  of posting is no need .  <eos> o !  what excuse will my poor beast then find ,  <eos> when swift extremity can seem but slow ?  <eos> then should i spur ,  though mounted on the wind ,  <eos> in winged speed no motion shall i know ,  <eos> then can no horse with my desire keep pace ;  <eos> therefore desire ,  of perfect 'st love being made ,  <eos> shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race ,  <eos> but love ,  for love ,  thus shall excuse my jade :  <eos>  ' since from thee going ,  he went wilful-slow ,  <eos> towards thee i 'll run ,  and give him leave to go .  ' <eos><eos> can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure ,  <eos> the which he will not every hour survey ,  <eos> for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure .  <eos> therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare ,  <eos> since ,  seldom coming in that long year set ,  <eos> like stones of worth they thinly placed are ,  <eos> or captain jewels in the carcanet .  <eos> so is the time that keeps you as my chest ,  <eos> or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide ,  <eos> to make some special instant special-blest ,  <eos> by new unfolding his imprison 'd pride .  <eos> blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope ,  <eos> being had ,  to triumph ;  being lacked ,  to hope .  <eos><eos> that millions of strange shadows on you tend ?  <eos> since every one ,  hath every one ,  one shade ,  <eos> and you but one ,  can every shadow lend .  <eos> describe adonis ,  and the counterfeit <eos> is poorly imitated after you ;  <eos> on helen 's cheek all art of beauty set ,  <eos> and you in grecian tires are painted new :  <eos> speak of the spring ,  and foison of the year ,  <eos> the one doth shadow of your beauty show ,  <eos> the other as your bounty doth appear ;  <eos> and you in every blessed shape we know .  <eos> in all external grace you have some part ,  <eos> but you like none ,  none you ,  for constant heart .  <eos><eos> by that sweet ornament which truth doth give .  <eos> the rose looks fair ,  but fairer we it deem <eos> for that sweet odour ,  which doth in it live .  <eos> the canker blooms have full as deep a dye <eos> as the perfumed tincture of the roses .  <eos> hang on such thorns ,  and play as wantonly <eos> when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses :  <eos> but ,  for their virtue only is their show ,  <eos> they live unwoo 'd ,  and unrespected fade ;  <eos> die to themselves .  sweet roses do not so ;  <eos> of their sweet deaths ,  are sweetest odours made :  <eos> and so of you ,  beauteous and lovely youth ,  <eos> when that shall vade ,  by verse distills your truth .  <eos><eos> of princes ,  shall outlive this powerful rhyme ;  <eos> but you shall shine more bright in these contents <eos> than unswept stone ,  besmear 'd with sluttish time .  <eos> when wasteful war shall statues overturn ,  <eos> and broils root out the work of masonry ,  <eos> nor mars his sword ,  nor war 's quick fire shall burn <eos> the living record of your memory .  <eos>  'gainst death ,  and all-oblivious enmity <eos> shall you pace forth ;  your praise shall still find room <eos> even in the eyes of all posterity <eos> that wear this world out to the ending doom .  <eos> so ,  till the judgment that yourself arise ,  <eos> you live in this ,  and dwell in lovers ' eyes .  <eos><eos> thy edge should blunter be than appetite ,  <eos> which but to-day by feeding is allay 'd ,  <eos> to-morrow sharpened in his former might :  <eos> so ,  love ,  be thou ,  although to-day thou fill <eos> thy hungry eyes ,  even till they wink with fulness ,  <eos> to-morrow see again ,  and do not kill <eos> the spirit of love ,  with a perpetual dulness .  <eos> let this sad interim like the ocean be <eos> which parts the shore ,  where two contracted new <eos> come daily to the banks ,  that when they see <eos> return of love ,  more blest may be the view ;  <eos> or call it winter ,  which being full of care ,  <eos> makes summer 's welcome ,  thrice more wished ,  more rare .  <eos><eos> upon the hours ,  and times of your desire ?  <eos> i have no precious time at all to spend ;  <eos> nor services to do ,  till you require .  <eos> nor dare i chide the world-without-end hour ,  <eos> whilst i ,  my sovereign ,  watch the clock for you ,  <eos> nor think the bitterness of absence sour ,  <eos> when you have bid your servant once adieu ;  <eos> nor dare i question with my jealous thought <eos> where you may be ,  or your affairs suppose ,  <eos> but ,  like a sad slave ,  stay and think of nought <eos> save ,  where you are ,  how happy you make those .  <eos> so true a fool is love ,  that in your will ,  <eos> though you do anything ,  he thinks no ill .  <eos><eos> i should in thought control your times of pleasure ,  <eos> or at your hand the account of hours to crave ,  <eos> being your vassal ,  bound to stay your leisure !  <eos> o !  let me suffer ,  being at your beck ,  <eos> the imprison 'd absence of your liberty ;  <eos> and patience ,  tame to sufferance ,  bide each check ,  <eos> without accusing you of injury .  <eos> be where you list ,  your charter is so strong <eos> that you yourself may privilage your time <eos> to what you will ;  to you it doth belong <eos> yourself to pardon of self-doing crime .  <eos> i am to wait ,  though waiting so be hell ,  <eos> not blame your pleasure be it ill or well .  <eos><eos> hath been before ,  how are our brains beguil 'd ,  <eos> which labouring for invention bear amiss <eos> the second burthen of a former child !  <eos> o !  that record could with a backward look ,  <eos> even of five hundred courses of the sun ,  <eos> show me your image in some antique book ,  <eos> since mind at first in character was done !  <eos> that i might see what the old world could say <eos> to this composed wonder of your frame ;  <eos> wh 'r we are mended ,  or wh 'r better they ,  <eos> or whether revolution be the same .  <eos> o !  sure i am the wits of former days ,  <eos> to subjects worse have given admiring praise .  <eos><eos> so do our minutes hasten to their end ;  <eos> each changing place with that which goes before ,  <eos> in sequent toil all forwards do contend .  <eos> nativity ,  once in the main of light ,  <eos> crawls to maturity ,  wherewith being crown 'd ,  <eos> crooked eclipses  'gainst his glory fight ,  <eos> and time that gave doth now his gift confound .  <eos> time doth transfix the flourish set on youth <eos> and delves the parallels in beauty 's brow ,  <eos> feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth ,  <eos> and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow :  <eos> and yet to times in hope ,  my verse shall stand .  <eos> praising thy worth ,  despite his cruel hand .  <eos><eos> my heavy eyelids to the weary night ?  <eos> dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken ,  <eos> while shadows like to thee do mock my sight ?  <eos> is it thy spirit that thou send 'st from thee <eos> so far from home into my deeds to pry ,  <eos> to find out shames and idle hours in me ,  <eos> the scope and tenure of thy jealousy ?  <eos> o ,  no !  thy love ,  though much ,  is not so great :  <eos> it is my love that keeps mine eye awake :  <eos> mine own true love that doth my rest defeat ,  <eos> to play the watchman ever for thy sake :  <eos> for thee watch i ,  whilst thou dost wake elsewhere ,  <eos> from me far off ,  with others all too near .  <eos><eos> and all my soul ,  and all my every part ;  <eos> and for this sin there is no remedy ,  <eos> it is so grounded inward in my heart .  <eos> methinks no face so gracious is as mine ,  <eos> no shape so true ,  no truth of such account ;  <eos> and for myself mine own worth do define ,  <eos> as i all other in all worths surmount .  <eos> but when my glass shows me myself indeed <eos> beated and chopp 'd with tanned antiquity ,  <eos> mine own self-love quite contrary i read ;  <eos> self so self-loving were iniquity .  <eos>  'tis thee ,  myself ,  that for myself i praise ,  <eos> painting my age with beauty of thy days .  <eos><eos> with time 's injurious hand crush 'd and o 'erworn ;  <eos> when hours have drain 'd his blood and fill 'd his brow <eos> with lines and wrinkles ;  when his youthful morn <eos> hath travell 'd on to age 's steepy night ;  <eos> and all those beauties whereof now he 's king <eos> are vanishing ,  or vanished out of sight ,  <eos> stealing away the treasure of his spring ;  <eos> for such a time do i now fortify <eos> against confounding age 's cruel knife ,  <eos> that he shall never cut from memory <eos> my sweet love 's beauty ,  though my lover 's life :  <eos> his beauty shall in these black lines be seen ,  <eos> and they shall live ,  and he in them still green .  <eos><eos> the rich-proud cost of outworn buried age ;  <eos> when sometime lofty towers i see down-raz 'd ,  <eos> and brass eternal slave to mortal rage ;  <eos> when i have seen the hungry ocean gain <eos> advantage on the kingdom of the shore ,  <eos> and the firm soil win of the watery main ,  <eos> increasing store with loss ,  and loss with store ;  <eos> when i have seen such interchange of state ,  <eos> or state itself confounded ,  to decay ;  <eos> ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate :  <eos> that time will come and take my love away .  <eos> this thought is as a death which cannot choose <eos> but weep to have ,  that which it fears to lose .  <eos><eos> but sad mortality o 'ersways their power ,  <eos> how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea ,  <eos> whose action is no stronger than a flower ?  <eos> o !  how shall summer 's honey breath hold out ,  <eos> against the wrackful siege of battering days ,  <eos> when rocks impregnable are not so stout ,  <eos> nor gates of steel so strong but time decays ?  <eos> o fearful meditation !  where ,  alack ,  <eos> shall time 's best jewel from time 's chest lie hid ?  <eos> or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back ?  <eos> or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ?  <eos> o !  none ,  unless this miracle have might ,  <eos> that in black ink my love may still shine bright .  <eos><eos> as to behold desert a beggar born ,  <eos> and needy nothing trimm 'd in jollity ,  <eos> and purest faith unhappily forsworn ,  <eos> and gilded honour shamefully misplac 'd ,  <eos> and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted ,  <eos> and right perfection wrongfully disgrac 'd ,  <eos> and strength by limping sway disabled <eos> and art made tongue-tied by authority ,  <eos> and folly ,  doctor-like ,  controlling skill ,  <eos> and simple truth miscall 'd simplicity ,  <eos> and captive good attending captain ill :  <eos> tir 'd with all these ,  from these would i be gone ,  <eos> save that ,  to die ,  i leave my love alone .  <eos><eos> and with his presence grace impiety ,  <eos> that sin by him advantage should achieve ,  <eos> and lace itself with his society ?  <eos> why should false painting imitate his cheek ,  <eos> and steel dead seeming of his living hue ?  <eos> why should poor beauty indirectly seek <eos> roses of shadow ,  since his rose is true ?  <eos> why should he live ,  now nature bankrupt is ,  <eos> beggar 'd of blood to blush through lively veins ?  <eos> for she hath no exchequer now but his ,  <eos> and proud of many ,  lives upon his gains .  <eos> o !  him she stores ,  to show what wealth she had <eos> in days long since ,  before these last so bad .  <eos><eos> when beauty lived and died as flowers do now ,  <eos> before these bastard signs of fair were born ,  <eos> or durst inhabit on a living brow ;  <eos> before the golden tresses of the dead ,  <eos> the right of sepulchres ,  were shorn away ,  <eos> to live a second life on second head ;  <eos> ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay :  <eos> in him those holy antique hours are seen ,  <eos> without all ornament ,  itself and true ,  <eos> making no summer of another 's green ,  <eos> robbing no old to dress his beauty new ;  <eos> and him as for a map doth nature store ,  <eos> to show false art what beauty was of yore .  <eos><eos> want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend ;  <eos> all tongues ,  the voice of souls ,  give thee that due ,  <eos> uttering bare truth ,  even so as foes commend .  <eos> thy outward thus with outward praise is crown 'd ;  <eos> but those same tongues ,  that give thee so thine own ,  <eos> in other accents do this praise confound <eos> by seeing farther than the eye hath shown .  <eos> they look into the beauty of thy mind ,  <eos> and that in guess they measure by thy deeds ;  <eos> then churls their thoughts ,  although their eyes were kind ,  <eos> to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds :  <eos> but why thy odour matcheth not thy show ,  <eos> the soil is this ,  that thou dost common grow .  <eos><eos> for slander 's mark was ever yet the fair ;  <eos> the ornament of beauty is suspect ,  <eos> a crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air .  <eos> so thou be good ,  slander doth but approve <eos> thy worth the greater being woo 'd of time ;  <eos> for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love ,  <eos> and thou present 'st a pure unstained prime .  <eos> thou hast passed by the ambush of young days <eos> either not assail 'd ,  or victor being charg 'd ;  <eos> yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise ,  <eos> to tie up envy ,  evermore enlarg 'd ,  <eos> if some suspect of ill mask 'd not thy show ,  <eos> then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe .  <eos><eos> than you shall hear the surly sullen bell <eos> give warning to the world that i am fled <eos> from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell :  <eos> nay ,  if you read this line ,  remember not <eos> the hand that writ it ,  for i love you so ,  <eos> that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot ,  <eos> if thinking on me then should make you woe .  <eos> o if ,  i say ,  you look upon this verse ,  <eos> when i perhaps compounded am with clay ,  <eos> do not so much as my poor name rehearse ;  <eos> but let your love even with my life decay ;  <eos> lest the wise world should look into your moan ,  <eos> and mock you with me after i am gone .  <eos><eos> what merit lived in me ,  that you should love <eos> after my death ,  dear love ,  forget me quite ,  <eos> for you in me can nothing worthy prove ;  <eos> unless you would devise some virtuous lie ,  <eos> to do more for me than mine own desert ,  <eos> and hang more praise upon deceased i <eos> than niggard truth would willingly impart :  <eos> o !  lest your true love may seem false in this <eos> that you for love speak well of me untrue ,  <eos> my name be buried where my body is ,  <eos> and live no more to shame nor me nor you .  <eos> for i am shamed by that which i bring forth ,  <eos> and so should you ,  to love things nothing worth .  <eos><eos> when yellow leaves ,  or none ,  or few ,  do hang <eos> upon those boughs which shake against the cold ,  <eos> bare ruin 'd choirs ,  where late the sweet birds sang .  <eos> in me thou see 'st the twilight of such day <eos> as after sunset fadeth in the west ;  <eos> which by and by black night doth take away ,  <eos> death 's second self ,  that seals up all in rest .  <eos> in me thou see 'st the glowing of such fire ,  <eos> that on the ashes of his youth doth lie ,  <eos> as the death-bed ,  whereon it must expire ,  <eos> consum 'd with that which it was nourish 'd by .  <eos> this thou perceiv 'st ,  which makes thy love more strong ,  <eos> to love that well ,  which thou must leave ere long .  <eos><eos> without all bail shall carry me away ,  <eos> my life hath in this line some interest ,  <eos> which for memorial still with thee shall stay .  <eos> when thou reviewest this ,  thou dost review <eos> the very part was consecrate to thee :  <eos> the earth can have but earth ,  which is his due ;  <eos> my spirit is thine ,  the better part of me :  <eos> so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life ,  <eos> the prey of worms ,  my body being dead ;  <eos> the coward conquest of a wretch 's knife ,  <eos> too base of thee to be remembered .  <eos> the worth of that is that which it contains ,  <eos> and that is this ,  and this with thee remains .  <eos><eos> or as sweet-season 'd showers are to the ground ;  <eos> and for the peace of you i hold such strife <eos> as  'twixt a miser and his wealth is found .  <eos> now proud as an enjoyer ,  and anon <eos> doubting the filching age will steal his treasure ;  <eos> now counting best to be with you alone ,  <eos> then better 'd that the world may see my pleasure :  <eos> sometime all full with feasting on your sight ,  <eos> and by and by clean starved for a look ;  <eos> possessing or pursuing no delight ,  <eos> save what is had ,  or must from you be took .  <eos> thus do i pine and surfeit day by day ,  <eos> or gluttoning on all ,  or all away .  <eos><eos> so far from variation or quick change ?  <eos> why with the time do i not glance aside <eos> to new-found methods ,  and to compounds strange ?  <eos> why write i still all one ,  ever the same ,  <eos> and keep invention in a noted weed ,  <eos> that every word doth almost tell my name ,  <eos> showing their birth ,  and where they did proceed ?  <eos> o !  know sweet love i always write of you ,  <eos> and you and love are still my argument ;  <eos> so all my best is dressing old words new ,  <eos> spending again what is already spent :  <eos> for as the sun is daily new and old ,  <eos> so is my love still telling what is told .  <eos><eos> thy dial how thy precious minutes waste ;  <eos> these vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear ,  <eos> and of this book ,  this learning mayst thou taste .  <eos> the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show <eos> of mouthed graves will give thee memory ;  <eos> thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know <eos> time 's thievish progress to eternity .  <eos> look !  what thy memory cannot contain ,  <eos> commit to these waste blanks ,  and thou shalt find <eos> those children nursed ,  deliver 'd from thy brain ,  <eos> to take a new acquaintance of thy mind .  <eos> these offices ,  so oft as thou wilt look ,  <eos> shall profit thee and much enrich thy book .  <eos><eos> and found such fair assistance in my verse <eos> as every alien pen hath got my use <eos> and under thee their poesy disperse .  <eos> thine eyes ,  that taught the dumb on high to sing <eos> and heavy ignorance aloft to fly ,  <eos> have added feathers to the learned 's wing <eos> and given grace a double majesty .  <eos> yet be most proud of that which i compile ,  <eos> whose influence is thine ,  and born of thee :  <eos> in others ' works thou dost but mend the style ,  <eos> and arts with thy sweet graces graced be ;  <eos> but thou art all my art ,  and dost advance <eos> as high as learning ,  my rude ignorance .  <eos><eos> my verse alone had all thy gentle grace ;  <eos> but now my gracious numbers are decay 'd ,  <eos> and my sick muse doth give an other place .  <eos> i grant ,  sweet love ,  thy lovely argument <eos> deserves the travail of a worthier pen ;  <eos> yet what of thee thy poet doth invent <eos> he robs thee of ,  and pays it thee again .  <eos> he lends thee virtue ,  and he stole that word <eos> from thy behaviour ;  beauty doth he give ,  <eos> and found it in thy cheek :  he can afford <eos> no praise to thee ,  but what in thee doth live .  <eos> then thank him not for that which he doth say ,  <eos> since what he owes thee ,  thou thyself dost pay .  <eos><eos> knowing a better spirit doth use your name ,  <eos> and in the praise thereof spends all his might ,  <eos> to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame !  <eos> but since your wort ,  wide as the ocean is ,  <eos> the humble as the proudest sail doth bear ,  <eos> my saucy bark ,  inferior far to his ,  <eos> on your broad main doth wilfully appear .  <eos> your shallowest help will hold me up afloat ,  <eos> whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride ;  <eos> or ,  being wrack 'd ,  i am a worthless boat ,  <eos> he of tall building ,  and of goodly pride :  <eos> then if he thrive and i be cast away ,  <eos> the worst was this :  my love was my decay .  <eos><eos> or you survive when i in earth am rotten ;  <eos> from hence your memory death cannot take ,  <eos> although in me each part will be forgotten .  <eos> your name from hence immortal life shall have ,  <eos> though i ,  once gone ,  to all the world must die :  <eos> the earth can yield me but a common grave ,  <eos> when you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie .  <eos> your monument shall be my gentle verse ,  <eos> which eyes not yet created shall o 'er-read ;  <eos> and tongues to be ,  your being shall rehearse ,  <eos> when all the breathers of this world are dead ;  <eos> you still shall live ,  such virtue hath my pen ,  <eos> where breath most breathes ,  even in the mouths of men .  <eos><eos> and therefore mayst without attaint o 'erlook <eos> the dedicated words which writers use <eos> of their fair subject ,  blessing every book .  <eos> thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue ,  <eos> finding thy worth a limit past my praise ;  <eos> and therefore art enforced to seek anew <eos> some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days .  <eos> and do so ,  love ;  yet when they have devis 'd ,  <eos> what strained touches rhetoric can lend ,  <eos> thou truly fair ,  wert truly sympathiz 'd <eos> in true plain words ,  by thy true-telling friend ;  <eos> and their gross painting might be better us 'd <eos> where cheeks need blood ;  in thee it is abus 'd .  <eos><eos> and therefore to your fair no painting set ;  <eos> i found ,  or thought i found ,  you did exceed <eos> that barren tender of a poet 's debt :  <eos> and therefore have i slept in your report ,  <eos> that you yourself ,  being extant ,  well might show <eos> how far a modern quill doth come too short ,  <eos> speaking of worth ,  what worth in you doth grow .  <eos> this silence for my sin you did impute ,  <eos> which shall be most my glory being dumb ;  <eos> for i impair not beauty being mute ,  <eos> when others would give life ,  and bring a tomb .  <eos> there lives more life in one of your fair eyes <eos> than both your poets can in praise devise .  <eos><eos> than this rich praise :  that you alone are you ,  <eos> in whose confine immured is the store <eos> which should example where your equal grew .  <eos> lean penury within that pen doth dwell <eos> that to his subject lends not some small glory ;  <eos> but he that writes of you ,  if he can tell <eos> that you are you ,  so dignifies his story ,  <eos> let him but copy what in you is writ ,  <eos> not making worse what nature made so clear ,  <eos> and such a counterpart shall fame his wit ,  <eos> making his style admired every where .  <eos> you to your beauteous blessings add a curse ,  <eos> being fond on praise ,  which makes your praises worse .  <eos><eos> while comments of your praise richly compil 'd ,  <eos> reserve their character with golden quill ,  <eos> and precious phrase by all the muses fil 'd .  <eos> i think good thoughts ,  whilst others write good words ,  <eos> and like unlettered clerk still cry  ' amen ' <eos> to every hymn that able spirit affords ,  <eos> in polish 'd form of well-refined pen .  <eos> hearing you praised ,  i say  '  'tis so ,   'tis true ,  ' <eos> and to the most of praise add something more ;  <eos> but that is in my thought ,  whose love to you ,  <eos> though words come hindmost ,  holds his rank before .  <eos> then others ,  for the breath of words respect ,  <eos> me for my dumb thoughts ,  speaking in effect .  <eos><eos> bound for the prize of all too precious you ,  <eos> that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse ,  <eos> making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ?  <eos> was it his spirit ,  by spirits taught to write ,  <eos> above a mortal pitch ,  that struck me dead ?  <eos> no ,  neither he ,  nor his compeers by night <eos> giving him aid ,  my verse astonished .  <eos> he ,  nor that affable familiar ghost <eos> which nightly gulls him with intelligence ,  <eos> as victors of my silence cannot boast ;  <eos> i was not sick of any fear from thence :  <eos> but when your countenance fill 'd up his line ,  <eos> then lacked i matter ;  that enfeebled mine .  <eos><eos> and like enough thou know 'st thy estimate ,  <eos> the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing ;  <eos> my bonds in thee are all determinate .  <eos> for how do i hold thee but by thy granting ?  <eos> and for that riches where is my deserving ?  <eos> the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting ,  <eos> and so my patent back again is swerving .  <eos> thyself thou gav 'st ,  thy own worth then not knowing ,  <eos> or me to whom thou gav 'st it ,  else mistaking ;  <eos> so thy great gift ,  upon misprision growing ,  <eos> comes home again ,  on better judgement making .  <eos> thus have i had thee ,  as a dream doth flatter ,  <eos> in sleep a king ,  but waking no such matter .  <eos><eos> and place my merit in the eye of scorn ,  <eos> upon thy side ,  against myself i 'll fight ,  <eos> and prove thee virtuous ,  though thou art forsworn .  <eos> with mine own weakness ,  being best acquainted ,  <eos> upon thy part i can set down a story <eos> of faults conceal 'd ,  wherein i am attainted ;  <eos> that thou in losing me shalt win much glory :  <eos> and i by this will be a gainer too ;  <eos> for bending all my loving thoughts on thee ,  <eos> the injuries that to myself i do ,  <eos> doing thee vantage ,  double-vantage me .  <eos> such is my love ,  to thee i so belong ,  <eos> that for thy right ,  myself will bear all wrong .  <eos><eos> and i will comment upon that offence :  <eos> speak of my lameness ,  and i straight will halt ,  <eos> against thy reasons making no defence .  <eos> thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill ,  <eos> to set a form upon desired change ,  <eos> as i 'll myself disgrace ;  knowing thy will ,  <eos> i will acquaintance strangle ,  and look strange ;  <eos> be absent from thy walks ;  and in my tongue <eos> thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell ,  <eos> lest i ,  too much profane ,  should do it wrong ,  <eos> and haply of our old acquaintance tell .  <eos> for thee ,  against my self i 'll vow debate ,  <eos> for i must ne 'er love him whom thou dost hate .  <eos><eos> now ,  while the world is bent my deeds to cross ,  <eos> join with the spite of fortune ,  make me bow ,  <eos> and do not drop in for an after-loss :  <eos> ah !  do not ,  when my heart hath  'scap 'd this sorrow ,  <eos> come in the rearward of a conquer 'd woe ;  <eos> give not a windy night a rainy morrow ,  <eos> to linger out a purpos 'd overthrow .  <eos> if thou wilt leave me ,  do not leave me last ,  <eos> when other petty griefs have done their spite ,  <eos> but in the onset come :  so shall i taste <eos> at first the very worst of fortune 's might ;  <eos> and other strains of woe ,  which now seem woe ,  <eos> compar 'd with loss of thee ,  will not seem so .  <eos><eos> some in their wealth ,  some in their body 's force ,  <eos> some in their garments though new-fangled ill ;  <eos> some in their hawks and hounds ,  some in their horse ;  <eos> and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure ,  <eos> wherein it finds a joy above the rest :  <eos> but these particulars are not my measure ,  <eos> all these i better in one general best .  <eos> thy love is better than high birth to me ,  <eos> richer than wealth ,  prouder than garments ' costs ,  <eos> of more delight than hawks and horses be ;  <eos> and having thee ,  of all men 's pride i boast :  <eos> wretched in this alone ,  that thou mayst take <eos> all this away ,  and me most wretchcd make .  <eos><eos> for term of life thou art assured mine ;  <eos> and life no longer than thy love will stay ,  <eos> for it depends upon that love of thine .  <eos> then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs ,  <eos> when in the least of them my life hath end .  <eos> i see a better state to me belongs <eos> than that which on thy humour doth depend :  <eos> thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind ,  <eos> since that my life on thy revolt doth lie .  <eos> o !  what a happy title do i find ,  <eos> happy to have thy love ,  happy to die !  <eos> but what 's so blessed-fair that fears no blot ?  <eos> thou mayst be false ,  and yet i know it not .  <eos><eos> like a deceived husband ;  so love 's face <eos> may still seem love to me ,  though alter 'd new ;  <eos> thy looks with me ,  thy heart in other place :  <eos> for there can live no hatred in thine eye ,  <eos> therefore in that i cannot know thy change .  <eos> in many 's looks ,  the false heart 's history <eos> is writ in moods ,  and frowns ,  and wrinkles strange .  <eos> but heaven in thy creation did decree <eos> that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell ;  <eos> whate 'er thy thoughts ,  or thy heart 's workings be ,  <eos> thy looks should nothing thence ,  but sweetness tell .  <eos> how like eve 's apple doth thy beauty grow ,  <eos> if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show !  <eos><eos> that do not do the thing they most do show ,  <eos> who ,  moving others ,  are themselves as stone ,  <eos> unmoved ,  cold ,  and to temptation slow ;  <eos> they rightly do inherit heaven 's graces ,  <eos> and husband nature 's riches from expense ;  <eos> they are the lords and owners of their faces ,  <eos> others ,  but stewards of their excellence .  <eos> the summer 's flower is to the summer sweet ,  <eos> though to itself ,  it only live and die ,  <eos> but if that flower with base infection meet ,  <eos> the basest weed outbraves his dignity :  <eos> for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;  <eos> lilies that fester ,  smell far worse than weeds .  <eos><eos> which ,  like a canker in the fragrant rose ,  <eos> doth spot the beauty of thy budding name !  <eos> o !  in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose .  <eos> that tongue that tells the story of thy days ,  <eos> making lascivious comments on thy sport ,  <eos> cannot dispraise ,  but in a kind of praise ;  <eos> naming thy name ,  blesses an ill report .  <eos> o !  what a mansion have those vices got <eos> which for their habitation chose out thee ,  <eos> where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot <eos> and all things turns to fair that eyes can see !  <eos> take heed ,  dear heart ,  of this large privilege ;  <eos> the hardest knife ill-us 'd doth lose his edge .  <eos><eos> some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport ;  <eos> both grace and faults are lov 'd of more and less :  <eos> thou mak 'st faults graces that to thee resort .  <eos> as on the finger of a throned queen <eos> the basest jewel will be well esteem 'd ,  <eos> so are those errors that in thee are seen <eos> to truths translated ,  and for true things deem 'd .  <eos> how many lambs might the stern wolf betray ,  <eos> if like a lamb he could his looks translate !  <eos> how many gazers mightst thou lead away ,  <eos> if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state !  <eos> but do not so ;  i love thee in such sort ,  <eos> as ,  thou being mine ,  mine is thy good report .  <eos><eos> from thee ,  the pleasure of the fleeting year !  <eos> what freezings have i felt ,  what dark days seen !  <eos> what old december 's bareness everywhere !  <eos> and yet this time removed was summer 's time ;  <eos> the teeming autumn ,  big with rich increase ,  <eos> bearing the wanton burden of the prime ,  <eos> like widow 'd wombs after their lords ' decease :  <eos> yet this abundant issue seem 'd to me <eos> but hope of orphans ,  and unfather 'd fruit ;  <eos> for summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,  <eos> and ,  thou away ,  the very birds are mute :  <eos> or ,  if they sing ,   'tis with so dull a cheer ,  <eos> that leaves look pale ,  dreading the winter 's near .  <eos><eos> when proud-pied april ,  dress 'd in all his trim ,  <eos> hath put a spirit of youth in every thing ,  <eos> that heavy saturn laugh 'd and leap 'd with him .  <eos> yet nor the lays of birds ,  nor the sweet smell <eos> of different flowers in odour and in hue ,  <eos> could make me any summer 's story tell ,  <eos> or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew :  <eos> nor did i wonder at the lily 's white ,  <eos> nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose ;  <eos> they were but sweet ,  but figures of delight ,  <eos> drawn after you ,  you pattern of all those .  <eos> yet seem 'd it winter still ,  and you away ,  <eos> as with your shadow i with these did play .  <eos><eos> sweet thief ,  whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells ,  <eos> if not from my love 's breath ?  the purple pride <eos> which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells <eos> in my love 's veins thou hast too grossly dy 'd .  <eos> the lily i condemned for thy hand ,  <eos> and buds of marjoram had stol 'n thy hair ;  <eos> the roses fearfully on thorns did stand ,  <eos> one blushing shame ,  another white despair ;  <eos> a third ,  nor red nor white ,  had stol 'n of both ,  <eos> and to his robbery had annex 'd thy breath ;  <eos> but ,  for his theft ,  in pride of all his growth <eos> a vengeful canker eat him up to death .  <eos> more flowers i noted ,  yet i none could see ,  <eos> but sweet ,  or colour it had stol 'n from thee .  <eos><eos> to speak of that which gives thee all thy might ?  <eos> spend 'st thou thy fury on some worthless song ,  <eos> darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ?  <eos> return forgetful muse ,  and straight redeem ,  <eos> in gentle numbers time so idly spent ;  <eos> sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem <eos> and gives thy pen both skill and argument .  <eos> rise ,  resty muse ,  my love 's sweet face survey ,  <eos> if time have any wrinkle graven there ;  <eos> if any ,  be a satire to decay ,  <eos> and make time 's spoils despised every where .  <eos> give my love fame faster than time wastes life ,  <eos> so thou prevent 'st his scythe and crooked knife .  <eos><eos> for thy neglect of truth in beauty dy 'd ?  <eos> both truth and beauty on my love depends ;  <eos> so dost thou too ,  and therein dignified .  <eos> make answer muse :  wilt thou not haply say ,  <eos>  ' truth needs no colour ,  with his colour fix 'd ;  <eos> beauty no pencil ,  beauty 's truth to lay ;  <eos> but best is best ,  if never intermix 'd ' ?  <eos> because he needs no praise ,  wilt thou be dumb ?  <eos> excuse not silence so ,  for 't lies in thee <eos> to make him much outlive a gilded tomb <eos> and to be prais 'd of ages yet to be .  <eos> then do thy office ,  muse ;  i teach thee how <eos> to make him seem long hence as he shows now .  <eos><eos> i love not less ,  though less the show appear ;  <eos> that love is merchandiz 'd ,  whose rich esteeming ,  <eos> the owner 's tongue doth publish every where .  <eos> our love was new ,  and then but in the spring ,  <eos> when i was wont to greet it with my lays ;  <eos> as philomel in summer 's front doth sing ,  <eos> and stops her pipe in growth of riper days :  <eos> not that the summer is less pleasant now <eos> than when her mournful hymns did hush the night ,  <eos> but that wild music burthens every bough ,  <eos> and sweets grown common lose their dear delight .  <eos> therefore like her ,  i sometime hold my tongue :  <eos> because i would not dull you with my song .  <eos><eos> that having such a scope to show her pride ,  <eos> the argument ,  all bare ,  is of more worth <eos> than when it hath my added praise beside !  <eos> o !  blame me not ,  if i no more can write !  <eos> look in your glass ,  and there appears a face <eos> that over-goes my blunt invention quite ,  <eos> dulling my lines ,  and doing me disgrace .  <eos> were it not sinful then ,  striving to mend ,  <eos> to mar the subject that before was well ?  <eos> for to no other pass my verses tend <eos> than of your graces and your gifts to tell ;  <eos> and more ,  much more ,  than in my verse can sit ,  <eos> your own glass shows you when you look in it .  <eos><eos> for as you were when first your eye i ey 'd ,  <eos> such seems your beauty still .  three winters cold ,  <eos> have from the forests shook three summers ' pride ,  <eos> three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn 'd ,  <eos> in process of the seasons have i seen ,  <eos> three april perfumes in three hot junes burn 'd ,  <eos> since first i saw you fresh ,  which yet are green .  <eos> ah !  yet doth beauty like a dial-hand ,  <eos> steal from his figure ,  and no pace perceiv 'd ;  <eos> so your sweet hue ,  which methinks still doth stand ,  <eos> hath motion ,  and mine eye may be deceiv 'd :  <eos> for fear of which ,  hear this thou age unbred :  <eos> ere you were born was beauty 's summer dead .  <eos><eos> nor my beloved as an idol show ,  <eos> since all alike my songs and praises be <eos> to one ,  of one ,  still such ,  and ever so .  <eos> kind is my love to-day ,  to-morrow kind ,  <eos> still constant in a wondrous excellence ;  <eos> therefore my verse to constancy confin 'd ,  <eos> one thing expressing ,  leaves out difference .  <eos>  ' fair ,  kind ,  and true ,  ' is all my argument ,  <eos>  ' fair ,  kind ,  and true ,  ' varying to other words ;  <eos> and in this change is my invention spent ,  <eos> three themes in one ,  which wondrous scope affords .  <eos> fair ,  kind ,  and true ,  have often liv 'd alone ,  <eos> which three till now ,  never kept seat in one .  <eos><eos> i see descriptions of the fairest wights ,  <eos> and beauty making beautiful old rime ,  <eos> in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights ,  <eos> then ,  in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best ,  <eos> of hand ,  of foot ,  of lip ,  of eye ,  of brow ,  <eos> i see their antique pen would have express 'd <eos> even such a beauty as you master now .  <eos> so all their praises are but prophecies <eos> of this our time ,  all you prefiguring ;  <eos> and for they looked but with divining eyes ,  <eos> they had not skill enough your worth to sing :  <eos> for we ,  which now behold these present days ,  <eos> have eyes to wonder ,  but lack tongues to praise .  <eos><eos> of the wide world dreaming on things to come ,  <eos> can yet the lease of my true love control ,  <eos> supposed as forfeit to a confin 'd doom .  <eos> the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur 'd ,  <eos> and the sad augurs mock their own presage ;  <eos> incertainties now crown themselves assur 'd ,  <eos> and peace proclaims olives of endless age .  <eos> now with the drops of this most balmy time ,  <eos> my love looks fresh ,  and death to me subscribes ,  <eos> since ,  spite of him ,  i 'll live in this poor rime ,  <eos> while he insults o 'er dull and speechless tribes :  <eos> and thou in this shalt find thy monument ,  <eos> when tyrants ' crests and tombs of brass are spent .  <eos><eos> which hath not figur 'd to thee my true spirit ?  <eos> what 's new to speak ,  what now to register ,  <eos> that may express my love ,  or thy dear merit ?  <eos> nothing ,  sweet boy ;  but yet ,  like prayers divine ,  <eos> i must each day say o 'er the very same ;  <eos> counting no old thing old ,  thou mine ,  i thine ,  <eos> even as when first i hallow 'd thy fair name .  <eos> so that eternal love in love 's fresh case ,  <eos> weighs not the dust and injury of age ,  <eos> nor gives to necessary wrinkles place ,  <eos> but makes antiquity for aye his page ;  <eos> finding the first conceit of love there bred ,  <eos> where time and outward form would show it dead .  <eos><eos> though absence seem 'd my flame to qualify ,  <eos> as easy might i from my self depart <eos> as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie :  <eos> that is my home of love :  if i have rang 'd ,  <eos> like him that travels ,  i return again ;  <eos> just to the time ,  not with the time exchang 'd ,  <eos> so that myself bring water for my stain .  <eos> never believe though in my nature reign 'd ,  <eos> all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood ,  <eos> that it could so preposterously be stain 'd ,  <eos> to leave for nothing all thy sum of good ;  <eos> for nothing this wide universe i call ,  <eos> save thou ,  my rose ,  in it thou art my all .  <eos><eos> and made my self a motley to the view ,  <eos> gor 'd mine own thoughts ,  sold cheap what is most dear ,  <eos> made old offences of affections new ;  <eos> most true it is ,  that i have look 'd on truth <eos> askance and strangely ;  but ,  by all above ,  <eos> these blenches gave my heart another youth ,  <eos> and worse essays prov 'd thee my best of love .  <eos> now all is done ,  save what shall have no end :  <eos> mine appetite i never more will grind <eos> on newer proof ,  to try an older friend ,  <eos> a god in love ,  to whom i am confin 'd .  <eos> then give me welcome ,  next my heaven the best ,  <eos> even to thy pure and most most loving breast .  <eos><eos> the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds ,  <eos> that did not better for my life provide <eos> than public means which public manners breeds .  <eos> thence comes it that my name receives a brand ,  <eos> and almost thence my nature is subdu 'd <eos> to what it works in ,  like the dyer 's hand :  <eos> pity me ,  then ,  and wish i were renew 'd ;  <eos> whilst ,  like a willing patient ,  i will drink ,  <eos> potions of eisel  'gainst my strong infection ;  <eos> no bitterness that i will bitter think ,  <eos> nor double penance ,  to correct correction .  <eos> pity me then ,  dear friend ,  and i assure ye ,  <eos> even that your pity is enough to cure me .  <eos><eos> which vulgar scandal stamp 'd upon my brow ;  <eos> for what care i who calls me well or ill ,  <eos> so you o 'er-green my bad ,  my good allow ?  <eos> you are my all-the-world ,  and i must strive <eos> to know my shames and praises from your tongue ;  <eos> none else to me ,  nor i to none alive ,  <eos> that my steel 'd sense or changes right or wrong .  <eos> in so profound abysm i throw all care <eos> of others ' voices ,  that my adder 's sense <eos> to critic and to flatterer stopped are .  <eos> mark how with my neglect i do dispense :  <eos> you are so strongly in my purpose bred ,  <eos> that all the world besides methinks are dead .  <eos><eos> and that which governs me to go about <eos> doth part his function and is partly blind ,  <eos> seems seeing ,  but effectually is out ;  <eos> for it no form delivers to the heart <eos> of bird ,  of flower ,  or shape which it doth latch :  <eos> of his quick objects hath the mind no part ,  <eos> nor his own vision holds what it doth catch ;  <eos> for if it see the rud 'st or gentlest sight ,  <eos> the most sweet favour or deformed 'st creature ,  <eos> the mountain or the sea ,  the day or night :  <eos> the crow ,  or dove ,  it shapes them to your feature .  <eos> incapable of more ,  replete with you ,  <eos> my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue .  <eos><eos> drink up the monarch 's plague ,  this flattery ?  <eos> or whether shall i say ,  mine eye saith true ,  <eos> and that your love taught it this alchemy ,  <eos> to make of monsters and things indigest <eos> such cherubins as your sweet self resemble ,  <eos> creating every bad a perfect best ,  <eos> as fast as objects to his beams assemble ?  <eos> o !   'tis the first ,   'tis flattery in my seeing ,  <eos> and my great mind most kingly drinks it up :  <eos> mine eye well knows what with his gust is  'greeing ,  <eos> and to his palate doth prepare the cup :  <eos> if it be poison 'd ,   'tis the lesser sin <eos> that mine eye loves it and doth first begin .  <eos><eos> even those that said i could not love you dearer :  <eos> yet then my judgment knew no reason why <eos> my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer .  <eos> but reckoning time ,  whose million 'd accidents <eos> creep in  'twixt vows ,  and change decrees of kings ,  <eos> tan sacred beauty ,  blunt the sharp 'st intents ,  <eos> divert strong minds to the course of altering things ;  <eos> alas !  why fearing of time 's tyranny ,  <eos> might i not then say ,   ' now i love you best ,  ' <eos> when i was certain o 'er incertainty ,  <eos> crowning the present ,  doubting of the rest ?  <eos> love is a babe ,  then might i not say so ,  <eos> to give full growth to that which still doth grow ?  <eos><eos> admit impediments .  love is not love <eos> which alters when it alteration finds ,  <eos> or bends with the remover to remove :  <eos> o ,  no !  it is an ever-fixed mark ,  <eos> that looks on tempests and is never shaken ;  <eos> it is the star to every wandering bark ,  <eos> whose worth 's unknown ,  although his height be taken .  <eos> love 's not time 's fool ,  though rosy lips and cheeks <eos> within his bending sickle 's compass come ;  <eos> love alters not with his brief hours and weeks ,  <eos> but bears it out even to the edge of doom .  <eos> if this be error and upon me prov 'd ,  <eos> i never writ ,  nor no man ever lov 'd .  <eos><eos> wherein i should your great deserts repay ,  <eos> forgot upon your dearest love to call ,  <eos> whereto all bonds do tie me day by day ;  <eos> that i have frequent been with unknown minds ,  <eos> and given to time your own dear-purchas 'd right ;  <eos> that i have hoisted sail to all the winds <eos> which should transport me farthest from your sight .  <eos> book both my wilfulness and errors down ,  <eos> and on just proof surmise ,  accumulate ;  <eos> bring me within the level of your frown ,  <eos> but shoot not at me in your waken 'd hate ;  <eos> since my appeal says i did strive to prove <eos> the constancy and virtue of your love .  <eos><eos> with eager compounds we our palate urge ;  <eos> as ,  to prevent our maladies unseen ,  <eos> we sicken to shun sickness when we purge ;  <eos> even so ,  being full of your ne 'er-cloying sweetness ,  <eos> to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding ;  <eos> and ,  sick of welfare ,  found a kind of meetness <eos> to be diseas 'd ,  ere that there was true needing .  <eos> thus policy in love ,  to anticipate <eos> the ills that were not ,  grew to faults assur 'd ,  <eos> and brought to medicine a healthful state <eos> which ,  rank of goodness ,  would by ill be cur 'd ;  <eos> but thence i learn and find the lesson true ,  <eos> drugs poison him that so fell sick of you .  <eos><eos> distill 'd from limbecks foul as hell within ,  <eos> applying fears to hopes ,  and hopes to fears ,  <eos> still losing when i saw myself to win !  <eos> what wretched errors hath my heart committed ,  <eos> whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never !  <eos> how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted ,  <eos> in the distraction of this madding fever !  <eos> o benefit of ill !  now i find true <eos> that better is ,  by evil still made better ;  <eos> and ruin 'd love ,  when it is built anew ,  <eos> grows fairer than at first ,  more strong ,  far greater .  <eos> so i return rebuk 'd to my content ,  <eos> and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent .  <eos><eos> and for that sorrow ,  which i then did feel ,  <eos> needs must i under my transgression bow ,  <eos> unless my nerves were brass or hammer 'd steel .  <eos> for if you were by my unkindness shaken ,  <eos> as i by yours ,  you 've pass 'd a hell of time ;  <eos> and i ,  a tyrant ,  have no leisure taken <eos> to weigh how once i suffer 'd in your crime .  <eos> o !  that our night of woe might have remember 'd <eos> my deepest sense ,  how hard true sorrow hits ,  <eos> and soon to you ,  as you to me ,  then tender 'd <eos> the humble salve ,  which wounded bosoms fits !  <eos> but that your trespass now becomes a fee ;  <eos> mine ransoms yours ,  and yours must ransom me .  <eos><eos> when not to be receives reproach of being ;  <eos> and the just pleasure lost ,  which is so deem 'd <eos> not by our feeling ,  but by others ' seeing :  <eos> for why should others ' false adulterate eyes <eos> give salutation to my sportive blood ?  <eos> or on my frailties why are frailer spies ,  <eos> which in their wills count bad what i think good ?  <eos> no ,  i am that i am ,  and they that level <eos> at my abuses reckon up their own :  <eos> i may be straight though they themselves be bevel ;  <eos> by their rank thoughts ,  my deeds must not be shown ;  <eos> unless this general evil they maintain ,  <eos> all men are bad and in their badness reign .  <eos><eos> full character 'd with lasting memory ,  <eos> which shall above that idle rank remain ,  <eos> beyond all date ;  even to eternity :  <eos> or ,  at the least ,  so long as brain and heart <eos> have faculty by nature to subsist ;  <eos> till each to raz 'd oblivion yield his part <eos> of thee ,  thy record never can be miss 'd .  <eos> that poor retention could not so much hold ,  <eos> nor need i tallies thy dear love to score ;  <eos> therefore to give them from me was i bold ,  <eos> to trust those tables that receive thee more :  <eos> to keep an adjunct to remember thee <eos> were to import forgetfulness in me .  <eos><eos> thy pyramids built up with newer might <eos> to me are nothing novel ,  nothing strange ;  <eos> they are but dressings of a former sight .  <eos> our dates are brief ,  and therefore we admire <eos> what thou dost foist upon us that is old ;  <eos> and rather make them born to our desire <eos> than think that we before have heard them told .  <eos> thy registers and thee i both defy ,  <eos> not wondering at the present nor the past ,  <eos> for thy records and what we see doth lie ,  <eos> made more or less by thy continual haste .  <eos> this i do vow and this shall ever be ;  <eos> i will be true despite thy scythe and thee .  <eos><eos> it might for fortune 's bastard be unfather 'd ,  <eos> as subject to time 's love or to time 's hate ,  <eos> weeds among weeds ,  or flowers with flowers gather 'd .  <eos> no ,  it was builded far from accident ;  <eos> it suffers not in smiling pomp ,  nor falls <eos> under the blow of thralled discontent ,  <eos> whereto th ' inviting time our fashion calls :  <eos> it fears not policy ,  that heretic ,  <eos> which works on leases of short-number 'd hours ,  <eos> but all alone stands hugely politic ,  <eos> that it nor grows with heat ,  nor drowns with showers .  <eos> to this i witness call the fools of time ,  <eos> which die for goodness ,  who have lived for crime .  <eos><eos> with my extern the outward honouring ,  <eos> or laid great bases for eternity ,  <eos> which proves more short than waste or ruining ?  <eos> have i not seen dwellers on form and favour <eos> lose all and more by paying too much rent <eos> for compound sweet ;  forgoing simple savour ,  <eos> pitiful thrivers ,  in their gazing spent ?  <eos> no ;  let me be obsequious in thy heart ,  <eos> and take thou my oblation ,  poor but free ,  <eos> which is not mix 'd with seconds ,  knows no art ,  <eos> but mutual render ,  only me for thee .  <eos> hence ,  thou suborned informer !  a true soul <eos> when most impeach 'd ,  stands least in thy control .  <eos><eos> dost hold time 's fickle glass ,  his fickle hour ;  <eos> who hast by waning grown ,  and therein show 'st <eos> thy lovers withering ,  as thy sweet self grow 'st .  <eos> if nature ,  sovereign mistress over wrack ,  <eos> as thou goest onwards ,  still will pluck thee back ,  <eos> she keeps thee to this purpose ,  that her skill <eos> may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill .  <eos> yet fear her ,  o thou minion of her pleasure !  <eos> she may detain ,  but not still keep ,  her treasure :  <eos> her audit  ( though delayed )  answered must be ,  <eos> and her quietus is to render thee .  <eos><eos> or if it were ,  it bore not beauty 's name ;  <eos> but now is black beauty 's successive heir ,  <eos> and beauty slander 'd with a bastard shame :  <eos> for since each hand hath put on nature 's power ,  <eos> fairing the foul with art 's false borrowed face ,  <eos> sweet beauty hath no name ,  no holy bower ,  <eos> but is profan 'd ,  if not lives in disgrace .  <eos> therefore my mistress ' eyes are raven black ,  <eos> her eyes so suited ,  and they mourners seem <eos> at such who ,  not born fair ,  no beauty lack ,  <eos> sland 'ring creation with a false esteem :  <eos> yet so they mourn becoming of their woe ,  <eos> that every tongue says beauty should look so .  <eos><eos> upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds <eos> with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway 'st <eos> the wiry concord that mine ear confounds ,  <eos> do i envy those jacks that nimble leap ,  <eos> to kiss the tender inward of thy hand ,  <eos> whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap ,  <eos> at the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand !  <eos> to be so tickled ,  they would change their state <eos> and situation with those dancing chips ,  <eos> o 'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait ,  <eos> making dead wood more bless 'd than living lips .  <eos> since saucy jacks so happy are in this ,  <eos> give them thy fingers ,  me thy lips to kiss .  <eos><eos> is lust in action :  and till action ,  lust <eos> is perjur 'd ,  murderous ,  bloody ,  full of blame ,  <eos> savage ,  extreme ,  rude ,  cruel ,  not to trust ;  <eos> enjoy 'd no sooner but despised straight ;  <eos> past reason hunted ;  and no sooner had ,  <eos> past reason hated ,  as a swallow 'd bait ,  <eos> on purpose laid to make the taker mad :  <eos> mad in pursuit and in possession so ;  <eos> had ,  having ,  and in quest ,  to have extreme ;  <eos> a bliss in proof ,  and proved ,  a very woe ;  <eos> before ,  a joy propos 'd ;  behind a dream .  <eos> all this the world well knows ;  yet none knows well <eos> to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .  <eos><eos> coral is far more red ,  than her lips red :  <eos> if snow be white ,  why then her breasts are dun ;  <eos> if hairs be wires ,  black wires grow on her head .  <eos> i have seen roses damask 'd ,  red and white ,  <eos> but no such roses see i in her cheeks ;  <eos> and in some perfumes is there more delight <eos> than in the breath that from my mistress reeks .  <eos> i love to hear her speak ,  yet well i know <eos> that music hath a far more pleasing sound :  <eos> i grant i never saw a goddess go ;  <eos> my mistress ,  when she walks ,  treads on the ground :  <eos> and yet by heaven ,  i think my love as rare ,  <eos> as any she belied with false compare .  <eos><eos> as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel ;  <eos> for well thou know 'st to my dear doting heart <eos> thou art the fairest and most precious jewel .  <eos> yet ,  in good faith ,  some say that thee behold ,  <eos> thy face hath not the power to make love groan ;  <eos> to say they err i dare not be so bold ,  <eos> although i swear it to myself alone .  <eos> and to be sure that is not false i swear ,  <eos> a thousand groans ,  but thinking on thy face ,  <eos> one on another 's neck ,  do witness bear <eos> thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place .  <eos> in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds ,  <eos> and thence this slander ,  as i think ,  proceeds .  <eos><eos> knowing thy heart torment me with disdain ,  <eos> have put on black and loving mourners be ,  <eos> looking with pretty ruth upon my pain .  <eos> and truly not the morning sun of heaven <eos> better becomes the grey cheeks of the east ,  <eos> nor that full star that ushers in the even ,  <eos> doth half that glory to the sober west ,  <eos> as those two mourning eyes become thy face :  <eos> o !  let it then as well beseem thy heart <eos> to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace ,  <eos> and suit thy pity like in every part .  <eos> then will i swear beauty herself is black ,  <eos> and all they foul that thy complexion lack .  <eos><eos> for that deep wound it gives my friend and me !  <eos> is 't not enough to torture me alone ,  <eos> but slave to slavery my sweet 'st friend must be ?  <eos> me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken ,  <eos> and my next self thou harder hast engross 'd :  <eos> of him ,  myself ,  and thee i am forsaken ;  <eos> a torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross 'd :  <eos> prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward ,  <eos> but then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail ;  <eos> whoe 'er keeps me ,  let my heart be his guard ;  <eos> thou canst not then use rigour in my jail :  <eos> and yet thou wilt ;  for i ,  being pent in thee ,  <eos> perforce am thine ,  and all that is in me .  <eos><eos> and i my self am mortgag 'd to thy will ,  <eos> myself i 'll forfeit ,  so that other mine <eos> thou wilt restore to be my comfort still :  <eos> but thou wilt not ,  nor he will not be free ,  <eos> for thou art covetous ,  and he is kind ;  <eos> he learn 'd but surety-like to write for me ,  <eos> under that bond that him as fast doth bind .  <eos> the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take ,  <eos> thou usurer ,  that putt 'st forth all to use ,  <eos> and sue a friend came debtor for my sake ;  <eos> so him i lose through my unkind abuse .  <eos> him have i lost ;  thou hast both him and me :  <eos> he pays the whole ,  and yet am i not free .  <eos><eos> and  ' will ' to boot ,  and  ' will ' in over-plus ;  <eos> more than enough am i that vex 'd thee still ,  <eos> to thy sweet will making addition thus .  <eos> wilt thou ,  whose will is large and spacious ,  <eos> not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ?  <eos> shall will in others seem right gracious ,  <eos> and in my will no fair acceptance shine ?  <eos> the sea ,  all water ,  yet receives rain still ,  <eos> and in abundance addeth to his store ;  <eos> so thou ,  being rich in  ' will ,  ' add to thy  ' will ' <eos> one will of mine ,  to make thy large will more .  <eos> let no unkind  ' no ' fair beseechers kill ;  <eos> think all but one ,  and me in that one  ' will .  ' <eos><eos> swear to thy blind soul that i was thy  ' will ' ,  <eos> and will ,  thy soul knows ,  is admitted there ;  <eos> thus far for love ,  my love-suit ,  sweet ,  fulfil .  <eos>  ' will ' ,  will fulfil the treasure of thy love ,  <eos> ay ,  fill it full with wills ,  and my will one .  <eos> in things of great receipt with ease we prove <eos> among a number one is reckon 'd none :  <eos> then in the number let me pass untold ,  <eos> though in thy store 's account i one must be ;  <eos> for nothing hold me ,  so it please thee hold <eos> that nothing me ,  a something sweet to thee :  <eos> make but my name thy love ,  and love that still ,  <eos> and then thou lov 'st me for my name is  ' will .  ' <eos><eos> that they behold ,  and see not what they see ?  <eos> they know what beauty is ,  see where it lies ,  <eos> yet what the best is take the worst to be .  <eos> if eyes ,  corrupt by over-partial looks ,  <eos> be anchor 'd in the bay where all men ride ,  <eos> why of eyes ' falsehood hast thou forged hooks ,  <eos> whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ?  <eos> why should my heart think that a several plot ,  <eos> which my heart knows the wide world 's common place ?  <eos> or mine eyes ,  seeing this ,  say this is not ,  <eos> to put fair truth upon so foul a face ?  <eos> in things right true my heart and eyes have err 'd ,  <eos> and to this false plague are they now transferr 'd .  <eos><eos> i do believe her though i know she lies ,  <eos> that she might think me some untutor 'd youth ,  <eos> unlearned in the world 's false subtleties .  <eos> thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young ,  <eos> although she knows my days are past the best ,  <eos> simply i credit her false-speaking tongue :  <eos> on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed :  <eos> but wherefore says she not she is unjust ?  <eos> and wherefore say not i that i am old ?  <eos> o !  love 's best habit is in seeming trust ,  <eos> and age in love ,  loves not to have years told :  <eos> therefore i lie with her ,  and she with me ,  <eos> and in our faults by lies we flatter 'd be .  <eos><eos> that thy unkindness lays upon my heart ;  <eos> wound me not with thine eye ,  but with thy tongue :  <eos> use power with power ,  and slay me not by art ,  <eos> tell me thou lov 'st elsewhere ;  but in my sight ,  <eos> dear heart ,  forbear to glance thine eye aside :  <eos> what need 'st thou wound with cunning ,  when thy might <eos> is more than my o 'erpress 'd defence can bide ?  <eos> let me excuse thee :  ah !  my love well knows <eos> her pretty looks have been mine enemies ;  <eos> and therefore from my face she turns my foes ,  <eos> that they elsewhere might dart their injuries :  <eos> yet do not so ;  but since i am near slain ,  <eos> kill me outright with looks ,  and rid my pain .  <eos><eos> my tongue-tied patience with too much disdain ;  <eos> lest sorrow lend me words ,  and words express <eos> the manner of my pity-wanting pain .  <eos> if i might teach thee wit ,  better it were ,  <eos> though not to love ,  yet love to tell me so ,  <eos> as testy sick men ,  when their deaths be near ,  <eos> no news but health from their physicians know .  <eos> for ,  if i should despair ,  i should grow mad ,  <eos> and in my madness might speak ill of thee ;  <eos> now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad ,  <eos> mad slanderers by mad ears believed be .  <eos> that i may not be so ,  nor thou belied ,  <eos> bear thine eyes straight ,  though thy proud heart go wide .  <eos><eos> for they in thee a thousand errors note ;  <eos> but  'tis my heart that loves what they despise ,  <eos> who ,  in despite of view ,  is pleased to dote .  <eos> nor are mine ears with thy tongue 's tune delighted ;  <eos> nor tender feeling ,  to base touches prone ,  <eos> nor taste ,  nor smell ,  desire to be invited <eos> to any sensual feast with thee alone :  <eos> but my five wits nor my five senses can <eos> dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee ,  <eos> who leaves unsway 'd the likeness of a man ,  <eos> thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be :  <eos> only my plague thus far i count my gain ,  <eos> that she that makes me sin awards me pain .  <eos><eos> hate of my sin ,  grounded on sinful loving :  <eos> o !  but with mine compare thou thine own state ,  <eos> and thou shalt find it merits not reproving ;  <eos> or ,  if it do ,  not from those lips of thine ,  <eos> that have profan 'd their scarlet ornaments <eos> and seal 'd false bonds of love as oft as mine ,  <eos> robb 'd others ' beds ' revenues of their rents .  <eos> be it lawful i love thee ,  as thou lov 'st those <eos> whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee :  <eos> root pity in thy heart ,  that ,  when it grows ,  <eos> thy pity may deserve to pitied be .  <eos> if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide ,  <eos> by self-example mayst thou be denied !  <eos><eos> one of her feather 'd creatures broke away ,  <eos> sets down her babe ,  and makes all swift dispatch <eos> in pursuit of the thing she would have stay ;  <eos> whilst her neglected child holds her in chase ,  <eos> cries to catch her whose busy care is bent <eos> to follow that which flies before her face ,  <eos> not prizing her poor infant 's discontent ;  <eos> so runn 'st thou after that which flies from thee ,  <eos> whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind ;  <eos> but if thou catch thy hope ,  turn back to me ,  <eos> and play the mother 's part ,  kiss me ,  be kind ;  <eos> so will i pray that thou mayst have thy  ' will ,  ' <eos> if thou turn back and my loud crying still .  <eos><eos> which like two spirits do suggest me still :  <eos> the better angel is a man right fair ,  <eos> the worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill .  <eos> to win me soon to hell ,  my female evil ,  <eos> tempteth my better angel from my side ,  <eos> and would corrupt my saint to be a devil ,  <eos> wooing his purity with her foul pride .  <eos> and whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend ,  <eos> suspect i may ,  yet not directly tell ;  <eos> but being both from me ,  both to each friend ,  <eos> i guess one angel in another 's hell :  <eos> yet this shall i ne 'er know ,  but live in doubt ,  <eos> till my bad angel fire my good one out .  <eos><eos> breathed forth the sound that said  ' i hate ' ,  <eos> to me that languish 'd for her sake :  <eos> but when she saw my woeful state ,  <eos> straight in her heart did mercy come ,  <eos> chiding that tongue that ever sweet <eos> was us 'd in giving gentle doom ;  <eos> and taught it thus anew to greet ;  <eos>  ' i hate ' she alter 'd with an end ,  <eos> that followed it as gentle day ,  <eos> doth follow night ,  who like a fiend <eos> from heaven to hell is flown away .  <eos>  ' i hate ' ,  from hate away she threw ,  <eos> and sav 'd my life ,  saying  ' not you ' .  <eos><eos> my sinful earth these rebel powers array ,  <eos> why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth ,  <eos> painting thy outward walls so costly gay ?  <eos> why so large cost ,  having so short a lease ,  <eos> dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ?  <eos> shall worms ,  inheritors of this excess ,  <eos> eat up thy charge ?  is this thy body 's end ?  <eos> then soul ,  live thou upon thy servant 's loss ,  <eos> and let that pine to aggravate thy store ;  <eos> buy terms divine in selling hours of dross ;  <eos> within be fed ,  without be rich no more :  <eos> so shall thou feed on death ,  that feeds on men ,  <eos> and death once dead ,  there 's no more dying then .  <eos><eos> for that which longer nurseth the disease ;  <eos> feeding on that which doth preserve the ill ,  <eos> the uncertain sickly appetite to please .  <eos> my reason ,  the physician to my love ,  <eos> angry that his prescriptions are not kept ,  <eos> hath left me ,  and i desperate now approve <eos> desire is death ,  which physic did except .  <eos> past cure i am ,  now reason is past care ,  <eos> and frantic-mad with evermore unrest ;  <eos> my thoughts and my discourse as madmen 's are ,  <eos> at random from the truth vainly express 'd ;  <eos> for i have sworn thee fair ,  and thought thee bright ,  <eos> who art as black as hell ,  as dark as night .  <eos><eos> which have no correspondence with true sight ;  <eos> or ,  if they have ,  where is my judgment fled ,  <eos> that censures falsely what they see aright ?  <eos> if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote ,  <eos> what means the world to say it is not so ?  <eos> if it be not ,  then love doth well denote <eos> love 's eye is not so true as all men 's :  no ,  <eos> how can it ?  o !  how can love 's eye be true ,  <eos> that is so vexed with watching and with tears ?  <eos> no marvel then ,  though i mistake my view ;  <eos> the sun itself sees not ,  till heaven clears .  <eos> o cunning love !  with tears thou keep 'st me blind ,  <eos> lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find .  <eos><eos> when i against myself with thee partake ?  <eos> do i not think on thee ,  when i forgot <eos> am of my self ,  all tyrant ,  for thy sake ?  <eos> who hateth thee that i do call my friend ,  <eos> on whom frown 'st thou that i do fawn upon ,  <eos> nay ,  if thou lour 'st on me ,  do i not spend <eos> revenge upon myself with present moan ?  <eos> what merit do i in my self respect ,  <eos> that is so proud thy service to despise ,  <eos> when all my best doth worship thy defect ,  <eos> commanded by the motion of thine eyes ?  <eos> but ,  love ,  hate on ,  for now i know thy mind ;  <eos> those that can see thou lov 'st ,  and i am blind .  <eos><eos> with insufficiency my heart to sway ?  <eos> to make me give the lie to my true sight ,  <eos> and swear that brightness doth not grace the day ?  <eos> whence hast thou this becoming of things ill ,  <eos> that in the very refuse of thy deeds <eos> there is such strength and warrantise of skill ,  <eos> that ,  in my mind ,  thy worst all best exceeds ?  <eos> who taught thee how to make me love thee more ,  <eos> the more i hear and see just cause of hate ?  <eos> o !  though i love what others do abhor ,  <eos> with others thou shouldst not abhor my state :  <eos> if thy unworthiness rais 'd love in me ,  <eos> more worthy i to be belov 'd of thee .  <eos><eos> yet who knows not conscience is born of love ?  <eos> then ,  gentle cheater ,  urge not my amiss ,  <eos> lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove :  <eos> for ,  thou betraying me ,  i do betray <eos> my nobler part to my gross body 's treason ;  <eos> my soul doth tell my body that he may <eos> triumph in love ;  flesh stays no farther reason ,  <eos> but rising at thy name doth point out thee ,  <eos> as his triumphant prize .  proud of this pride ,  <eos> he is contented thy poor drudge to be ,  <eos> to stand in thy affairs ,  fall by thy side .  <eos> no want of conscience hold it that i call <eos> her  ' love ,  ' for whose dear love i rise and fall .  <eos><eos> but thou art twice forsworn ,  to me love swearing ;  <eos> in act thy bed-vow broke ,  and new faith torn ,  <eos> in vowing new hate after new love bearing :  <eos> but why of two oaths ' breach do i accuse thee ,  <eos> when i break twenty ?  i am perjur 'd most ;  <eos> for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee ,  <eos> and all my honest faith in thee is lost :  <eos> for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness ,  <eos> oaths of thy love ,  thy truth ,  thy constancy ;  <eos> and ,  to enlighten thee ,  gave eyes to blindness ,  <eos> or made them swear against the thing they see ;  <eos> for i have sworn thee fair ;  more perjured i ,  <eos> to swear against the truth so foul a lie .  <eos><eos> a maid of dian 's this advantage found ,  <eos> and his love-kindling fire did quickly steep <eos> in a cold valley-fountain of that ground ;  <eos> which borrow 'd from this holy fire of love ,  <eos> a dateless lively heat ,  still to endure ,  <eos> and grew a seeting bath ,  which yet men prove <eos> against strange maladies a sovereign cure .  <eos> but at my mistress ' eye love 's brand new-fired ,  <eos> the boy for trial needs would touch my breast ;  <eos> i ,  sick withal ,  the help of bath desired ,  <eos> and thither hied ,  a sad distemper 'd guest ,  <eos> but found no cure ,  the bath for my help lies <eos> where cupid got new fire ;  my mistress ' eyes .  <eos><eos> laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand ,  <eos> whilst many nymphs that vow 'd chaste life to keep <eos> came tripping by ;  but in her maiden hand <eos> the fairest votary took up that fire <eos> which many legions of true hearts had warm 'd ;  <eos> and so the general of hot desire <eos> was ,  sleeping ,  by a virgin hand disarm 'd .  <eos> this brand she quenched in a cool well by ,  <eos> which from love 's fire took heat perpetual ,  <eos> growing a bath and healthful remedy ,  <eos> for men diseas 'd ;  but i ,  my mistress ' thrall ,  <eos> came there for cure and this by that i prove ,  <eos> love 's fire heats water ,  water cools not love .  <eos>
